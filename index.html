            <strong>2014-2017,National Diploma</strong> I started my studies in
            Computer Systems at CPUT in the winter of 2014, the programme
            includes 2 year of studies and on year of internship. During the
            majority of the 1<sup>st</sup> year I studied general electrical
            engineering subjects. The 2<sup>nd</sup> included subjects related
            to computer engineering such as:
            <ul class="m-0" style="list-style: circle;">
              <li class="mt-2">Networks Systems - certified in CCNA 1-4</li>

              <li>Digital System - Microcontroller Programming</li>

            <strong>2018-Current,Bachelors Computer Systems</strong>
            I am currently one subject away from completing my Bachelors in
            Computer Systems. This course offers advanced concepts on topics
            that were imtroduced in the
            <abbr title="National Diploma">ND</abbr> course. Concepts like
            <em
              >Distrubuted Datatabase, Object Oriented Database, Database
              programming - writting scripts to handle triggers and stored
              procedures.</em
            >
            I also studied Software Engineering, a subjects that though me thae
            different approaches to Software Development to take depending on
            the type and size of the project. For example: when developing a
            <em><strong>game</strong></em> the features can be realised
            regularly even without performing thorough testing and follow the
            user's feedback to improve the features and/or Implement new ones.
            When building

                system</strong
              ></em
            >,the application must be developed in full as per the requirements
            and thoroughly tested and simulated before it is implemented.

                  For 7 months I worked as a desktop support trainee technician,
                  my day to troubleshooting and fixing network issues, helping
                  students with their practical lab work and doing minor

                  During using Java, JavaFx and MySQL. The purpose of the
                  application is to facilitate the process of selling components
                  to the students. Each student has their ownaccount which they
                  top up every time their balance runs low. The application also
                  keeps a record of all transactions performed on account for
                  auditing and dispute purposes. The application is also able to
                  issue a warning is issued when a component is running low on
                  stock so that appropriate action can betaken by the Lab
                  supervisor.

                  My work did not stop at extractig data, after the data
                  extraction I would then create on or more templates to
                  visualize the data. The template could be a PDF be sent a
                  printer,saved into a folder or even sent to Document
                  management systems such as DocuWare, Laserfiche or SharePoint.
